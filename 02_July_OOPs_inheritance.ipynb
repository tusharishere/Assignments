    "2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their\n",
    "   differences and advantages.\n",
    "    \n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, single inheritance and multiple inheritance are \n",
    "two different approaches to class inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    ".Single Inheritance:\n",
    "Single inheritance refers to the concept where a class inherits properties and methods from \n",
    "a single parent class. In this approach, a derived class can have only one direct base class.\n",
    "The derived class inherits all the public and protected members of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Simplicity: Single inheritance keeps the class hierarchy simple and easy to understand.\n",
    "2)Encapsulation: It promotes encapsulation by allowing classes to inherit and extend functionality \n",
    "                 from a single source.\n",
    "3)Code Reusability: Single inheritance facilitates code reuse by inheriting common attributes and \n",
    "                    behaviors from a single base class.\n",
    ".Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a concept where a class can inherit properties and methods from multiple \n",
    "parent classes. In this approach, a derived class can have more than one direct base class. \n",
    "The derived class inherits all the public and protected members of each base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows for greater code reuse by inheriting from multiple sources,\n",
    "                    enabling a class to incorporate features from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "2)Flexibility: It offers more flexibility in creating complex class relationships and modeling real-world \n",
    "               scenarios where a class may possess characteristics from different domains.\n",
    "3)Polymorphism: Multiple inheritance facilitates polymorphism by allowing a derived class to inherit and \n",
    "                override methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Differences between Single Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Number of Base Classes: Single inheritance involves inheriting from a single base class, \n",
    "                          whereas multiple inheritance involves inheriting from multiple base classes.\n",
    "2)Complexity: Multiple inheritance can introduce more complexity due to potential conflicts or ambiguities \n",
    "              when inherited classes define members with the same name. \n",
    "              This is known as the \"diamond problem.\"\n",
    "3)Simplicity vs. Flexibility: Single inheritance provides simplicity and straightforwardness in class \n",
    "                              hierarchies, while multiple inheritance offers greater flexibility and the \n",
    "                              ability to combine features from different sources."

    "3. Explain the terms \"base class\" and \"derived class\" in the context of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Class: A base class, also known as a parent class or superclass, is the class from which other \n",
    "            classes inherit properties and methods. It serves as the foundation or template for creating \n",
    "            derived classes. The base class defines the common attributes and behaviors that are shared \n",
    "            by its derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Derived Class: A derived class, also known as a child class or subclass, is a class that inherits \n",
    "               properties and methods from a base class. It extends or specializes the functionality \n",
    "               of the base class by adding its own unique attributes and behaviors. The derived class \n",
    "               can also override or modify the inherited members to tailor them to its specific needs."

    "\n",
    "The \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance allows the member variables and methods of a \n",

    "\"private\" modifier, which restricts access to only within the class, and the \"public\" modifier, \n",
